## Power BI and Analytics Technical Skills:
+ Project Planning and Documentation
+ Data Gathering
+ Power Query
+ Data Modelling
+ Report Design
+ Data Visualization
+ Data Analysis Expression (DAX)

## Data Modelling
To optimize the performance of the data model, a calendar table was created using the DAX function. The data model follows a star schema with one fact table and three dimension tables. The dimension tables have PRIMARY KEYS that connect to the corresponding FOREIGN KEYS in the fact table, forming a one-to-many relationship between each dimension table and the fact table. The diagram below shows the data model.

## Report Design and Visualization
The Report Canvas was designed in Power Point and imported to PowerBI as canvas background. Here is a sample of the slide in Power Point

5 pages were created; Home, Consolidated, Stationery, Cosmetics and Electronics.

On each page, the new card visual is used to hold Total Sales, Gross Sales and Profit, Line Chart is used for the series analysis while a column and bar chart are adopted for the Continental and Country analysis respectively. The last image is the button for page navigation.

2. Haut‚Äôs management should continue their market strategy that leads to higher profits and better customer satisfaction
3. The cosmetics product category demands more research and development to boost its sales and profitability
4. Promotions (discounts) drive most of the sales in Haut stores, making them competitive in the dynamic market. Therefore, other promotional and marketing strategies should be implemented to enhance sales and profit
5. Products in Africa and China stores should be tailored to the specific needs of these markets through careful research
